					<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL CONDITIONS OF SALE</b></p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>These general conditions of sale (hereinafter known as the "<b>General Conditions of Sale</b>")
						shall regulate the goods offered and sold on the web site, www.castioficial.com
						&nbsp;(hereinafter known as the "<b>Site</b>").</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>You must read and accept these General Conditions of Sale to be able to send a purchase
						order. Non-acceptance of the General Conditions of Sale shall make it impossible to purchase
						goods from the Site.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><b>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RECITALS </b></p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>1.1&nbsp; The General Conditions of Sale shall exclusively regulate the offer, the shipping
						and acceptance of the purchase orders for Products on the Site, between the Seller and Site
						users.</p>
					<p>1.2&nbsp; The Seller, by means of the Site, shall offer the Products for sale and shall
						perform its e-commerce activities exclusively in relation to its final end-users, who are
						adults and "consumers", or rather, natural persons, who do not act in relation to any
						commercial, entrepreneurial, artisan or professional activities that might, eventually, be
						conducted (hereinafter known as the "<b>Client</b>").</p>
					<p>1.3&nbsp; The offer and sale of the Products refers exclusively to the countries set forth in
						the list of shipment countries listed on the relative page of the Site, which can be reached
						by means of the Homepage.</p>
					<p>1.4&nbsp; The Seller, therefore, shall be entitled not to process any orders from
						individuals, other than the "consumer" and/or minors, from countries that are not included
						among the shipment countries or, in any case, orders that are not in compliance with its own
						commercial policy.</p>
					<p>1.5&nbsp; The General Conditions of Sale do not regulate the sale of goods or supply of
						services by individuals other than the Seller, even if they are present on the Site by means
						of links, banners or other linking methods. The Client shall undertake to check the
						conditions of sale, prior to sending orders and purchasing goods and services from
						individuals other than the Seller. The latter, therefore, shall not be held liable for the
						sale of goods and/or the supply of services by third parties and/or the execution of
						agreements between the Client and third parties.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><b>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRODUCT PURCHASE ORDERS</b></p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>2.1&nbsp; The Client, in order to purchase one or more Products on the Site, must select the
						Products he wishes to purchase and add them to the shopping trolley. Once he has chosen the
						Products, the Client must go to the checkout on the shopping trolley web page, complete the
						order form electronically, in compliance with the relative instructions, and send it to the
						Seller.</p>
					<p>2.2&nbsp; The purchase orders may be made in English.</p>
					<p>2.3&nbsp; The Product purchase orders may be made by the Client both by means of his, own
						account, if he has registered his details on the site, or as a "guest", supplying, in this
						case, the personal details required to process the order.</p>
					<p>2.4&nbsp; Reference to the General Conditions of Sale has been set forth in the order form,
						as well as a summary concerning the main characteristics of each Product ordered, and the
						relative price (including all the applicable tax and duties), the methods of payment
						accepted and the delivery terms applied to the Products purchased, the shipment and delivery
						costs, the conditions established to assert withdrawal rights, and the conditions and times
						to return the Products purchased.</p>
					<p>2.5&nbsp; Prior to going ahead with purchasing the Products, by sending the order form, the
						Client shall undertake to read the General Conditions of Sale, which can also be printed,
						memorised or copied for personal use.&nbsp; The Client, by sending the order form, hereby
						declares that he has understood and approved the contents set forth in the form, as well as
						accepted the General Conditions of Sale and Use of the Site whilst, if he cannot, the order
						form cannot be sent.</p>
					<p>2.6&nbsp; Prior to sending the purchase order form, the Client can check the order details,
						as well as identify and correct any mistakes in entering the data.</p>
					<p>2.7&nbsp; Furthermore, when the order form is sent by the Client, this implies that the
						latter has undertaken to pay the price indicated in the order.</p>
					<p>2.8&nbsp; Once the purchase order has been accepted, the Seller shall undertake to send the
						Client a purchase order receipt, which shall contain a summary of the General Conditions of
						Sale, the information relative to the Products&rsquo; essential characteristics, a detailed
						indication of the price (including all the applicable tax and duties), the methods of
						payment, the conditions and ways of asserting the withdrawal entitlement and the delivery
						charges. &nbsp;</p>
					<p>2.9&nbsp; The Seller is entitled not to accept any purchase orders that are incomplete or
						have not been filled in correctly, which do not provide sufficient solvency guarantees or if
						the Products are unavailable. In these instances, the Seller shall promptly undertake and,
						in any case, within fourteen (14) days, running from the date on which the order was sent to
						the Seller, inform the Client, by e-mail, that the agreement has not been executed and that
						the Seller shall not process the purchase order. In the case in which the Client has already
						sent the order form and paid for the Products, the Seller shall undertake to reimburse the
						monies paid.</p>
					<p>2.10&nbsp; The order form shall be archived in the Seller&rsquo;s data bank for the time
						required to process the orders and, in any case, in compliance with the terms of the law in
						force.&nbsp; The Client, if registered on the Site, shall be able to see the orders made,
						access his, own account and consult the specific section on the Site. The Client who has
						made the purchase as a "guest" shall be entitled to check the orders made by contacting
						Customer Services, as indicated in paragraph 11 "Customer Care" herebelow.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><b>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRODUCTS&rsquo; CHARACTERISTICS </b></p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>3.1&nbsp; Original Products, characterised by the brand name, "Casti  Collection",
						are exclusively offered for sale on the Site, further to authorisation granted by
						Serendipity Srl and/or any, other individual authorised by the latter.</p>
					<p>3.2&nbsp; The Products&rsquo; essential characteristics have been set forth on the Site, in
						each Product description.&nbsp; The images and colours relative to the Products on sale
						might not, however, correspond to the real ones, caused by the Internet browser and/or
						monitor used.</p>
					<p>3.3&nbsp; Each Product is sold on the Site together with its identification tag, which
						constitutes an integral part of the Product.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><b>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAYMENTS </b></p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>4.1&nbsp; The Product prices set forth on the Site are calculated in Euro (&euro;) and do not
						include shipment and delivery costs, which are clearly indicated at the beginning of Product
						purchase procedure.</p>
					<p>4.2&nbsp; The Product prices may be subject to variations.&nbsp; The Client shall undertake,
						therefore, to check the final sales price prior to sending the relative order form.</p>
					<p>4.3&nbsp; The payment conditions can be referred to on the Site <a
							href="paymentsecurity/default.htm"><b>Payments</b></a> page, which have also been set
						forth on each, individual purchase order form, and constitute an integral part of the
						General Conditions of Sale.</p>
					<p>4.4&nbsp; The Product purchase price and the shipping costs, as set forth in the order form,
						shall be charged by the Seller when the Products are shipped.</p>
					<p>4.5&nbsp; In the case in which payment is made by credit card, the financial information
						(such as, for example, the credit or debit card number or its expiry date) shall be
						forwarded encrypted to banks or companies that supply the relative electronic distance
						payment services, without any third person whatsoever having access to the same.
						Furthermore, said information shall never be used by the Seller except for completing the
						procedures relative to the purchase, for which it was provided, and to issue any
						reimbursement in case of the Products being returned, further to asserting the withdrawal
						entitlement or to prevent or report fraud having been committed on the Site to the
						Police.</p>
					<p>4.6&nbsp; If the Product is delivered to a European Union country, it should not be subject
						to any Customs Clearance costs, such as import taxes and/or duties.</p>
					<p>If, instead, delivery is made to a country that does not belong to the European Union, the
						Products sold might be subject to Customs Clearance costs, such as importation taxes and/or
						duties, which are demanded on the Product&rsquo;s arrival in the country of delivery.&nbsp;
						The Customs Clearance costs cannot be envisaged by the Seller in advance, and they shall, in
						any case, be fully borne by the Client.</p>
					<p>If you require some more information, the Client should contact the Customs and Excise office
						in the country where the Product is shipped.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><b>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRODUCT DELIVERY</b></p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>5.1&nbsp; The Products, ordered on the Site, are sent by express courier service. The Product
						delivery costs, methods and terms have been set forth on the <span
								style="text-decoration: underline;">"</span><a href="shipping.html"><b><span
								style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping</span></b></a><span
								style="text-decoration: underline;">"</span> page, as well as on each, individual
						purchase form, and shall constitute an integral part of the General Conditions of Sale.</p>
					<p>5.2&nbsp; The Product delivery time, on the Site, refers exclusively to working days,
						explicitly excluding public holidays.</p>
					<p>5.3&nbsp; The Client must make the purchase order directly on the Site page relative to the
						country where the purchased Product shall be delivered. The Site should be capable of
						automatically recognising the country from which the Client is connecting, but you can
						change the Site reference country by means of the list of shipment countries that have been
						drawn up on the relative Site page.</p>
					<p>The orders made from one section of the Site relative to a country other than the one where
						the Products are to be shipped or to a country other than the one envisaged as the
						destination or to an address that is not admitted by the courier appointed by the Seller
						(such as, for example, P.O. boxes and Hold Mail services), shall not be accepted. The Site
						is not authorised to send goods to: Channel Islands and Isle of Man (UK), Canary Islands,
						Ceuta and Melilla (ES), Greenland (DK) and Puerto Rico.</p>
