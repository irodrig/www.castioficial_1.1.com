<p>1.4&nbsp; The Seller, therefore, shall be entitled not to process any orders from individuals, other than the "consumer" and/or minors, from countries that are not included among the shipment countries or, in any case, orders that are not in compliance with its own commercial policy.</p>
<p>1.5&nbsp; The General Conditions of Sale do not regulate the sale of goods or supply of services by individuals other than the Seller, even if they are present on the Site by means of links, banners or other linking methods.

<p>2.3&nbsp; The Product purchase orders may be made by the Client both by means of his, own account, if he has registered his details on the site, or as a "guest", supplying, in this case, the personal details required to process the order.</p>

<p>2.5&nbsp; Prior to going ahead with purchasing the Products, by sending the order form, the Client shall undertake to read the General Conditions of Sale, which can also be printed, memorised or copied for personal use.&nbsp; The Client, by sending the order form, hereby declares that he has understood and approved the contents set forth in the form, as well as accepted the General Conditions of Sale and Use of the Site whilst, if he cannot, the order form cannot be sent.</p>
<p>2.6&nbsp; Prior to sending the purchase order form, the Client can check the order details, as well as identify and correct any mistakes in entering the data.</p>
<p>2.7&nbsp; Furthermore, when the order form is sent by the Client, this implies that the latter has undertaken to pay the price indicated in the order.</p>
<p>2.8&nbsp; Once the purchase order has been accepted, the Seller shall undertake to send the Client a purchase order receipt, which shall contain a summary of the General Conditions of Sale, the information relative to the Products&rsquo; essential characteristics, a detailed indication of the price (including all the applicable tax and duties), the methods of payment, the conditions and ways of asserting the withdrawal entitlement and the delivery charges. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.9&nbsp; The Seller is entitled not to accept any purchase orders that are incomplete or have not been filled in correctly, which do not provide sufficient solvency guarantees or if the Products are unavailable. In these instances, the Seller shall promptly undertake and, in any case, within fourteen (14) days, running from the date on which the order was sent to the Seller, inform the Client, by e-mail, that the agreement has not been executed and that the Seller shall not process the purchase order. In the case in which the Client has already sent the order form and paid for the Products, the Seller shall undertake to reimburse the monies paid.</p>

<p>3.2&nbsp; The Products&rsquo; essential characteristics have been set forth on the Site, in each Product description.&nbsp; The images and colours relative to the Products on sale might not, however, correspond to the real ones, caused by the Internet browser and/or monitor used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAYMENTS </b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>4.1&nbsp; The Product prices set forth on the Site are calculated in Euro (&euro;) and do not include shipment and delivery costs, which are clearly indicated at the beginning of Product purchase procedure.</p>
<p>4.2&nbsp; The Product prices may be subject to variations.&nbsp; The Client shall undertake, therefore, to check the final sales price prior to sending the relative order form.</p>
<p>4.3&nbsp; The payment conditions can be referred to on the Site <a href="paymentsecurity/default.htm"><b>Payments</b></a> page, which have also been set forth on each, individual purchase order form, and constitute an integral part of the General Conditions of Sale.</p>
<p>4.4&nbsp; The Product purchase price and the shipping costs, as set forth in the order form, shall be charged by the Seller when the Products are shipped.</p>
<p>4.5&nbsp; In the case in which payment is made by credit card, the financial information (such as, for example, the credit or debit card number or its expiry date) shall be forwarded encrypted to banks or companies that supply the relative electronic distance payment services, without any third person whatsoever having access to the same. Furthermore, said information shall never be used by the Seller except for completing the procedures relative to the purchase, for which it was provided, and to issue any reimbursement in case of the Products being returned, further to asserting the withdrawal entitlement or to prevent or report fraud having been committed on the Site to the Police.</p>
<p>4.6&nbsp; If the Product is delivered to a European Union country, it should not be subject to any Customs Clearance costs, such as import taxes and/or duties.</p>
<p>If, instead, delivery is made to a country that does not belong to the European Union, the Products sold might be subject to Customs Clearance costs, such as importation taxes and/or duties, which are demanded on the Product&rsquo;s arrival in the country of delivery.&nbsp; The Customs Clearance costs cannot be envisaged by the Seller in advance, and they shall, in any case, be fully borne by the Client.</p>
<p>If you require some more information, the Client should contact the Customs and Excise office in the country where the Product is shipped.</p>

<p><b>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEGAL GUARANTEE OF CONFORMITY</b></p>

<p>In order to take advantage of this guarantee of conformity, the Client, at the risk of forfeiting this right, must inform the Seller of any defect in the Product purchased within two (2) months of having found it.</p>
<p>In the case of any defect in conformity reported within the terms envisaged, the Client shall be entitled, at his own decision, to have the Seller repair the goods or replace them, without any costs being incurred in both cases, except when the remedy requested is objectively impossible or excessively burdensome compared to the other one.&nbsp; The Client shall also be entitled to request, at his own decision, an adequate reduction in the price paid or termination of the agreement, in those instances in which repair or replacement are impossible or excessively burdensome, the Seller has not repaired or replaced the goods within an adequate period of time or the replacement or repair, previously performed, has incurred considerable inconvenience for the Client.</p>
<p>If you wish to take advantage of the guarantee of conformity, you should keep and show the Product&rsquo;s purchase documents</p>
<p>For more information concerning the consumer legal guarantee of conformity, the Client should consult the Consumer Code.</p>
